# **Scalability through Hierarchical Gap Encoding**

This code evaluates the performance of **hierarchical gap encoding** for graph data, comparing it against the traditional adjacency matrix representation in terms of memory usage, encoding time, and scalability. Using both synthetic and real-world graph datasets, the hierarchical gap encoding method demonstrates significant improvements in computational efficiency, memory reduction, and scalability, aligning with metrics tested on datasets like Cora and PubMed citation networks.

# Key Steps and Evaluation:
1. **Graph Partitioning**: The Louvain method is used to partition the graph into communities to improve modularity and facilitate efficient encoding. Communities are identified, and subgraphs are extracted for further processing.
2. **Gap Encoding**: Within each subgraph, node IDs are sorted, and the differences (gaps) between consecutive IDs are encoded. This reduces storage requirements while retaining critical structural information.
3. **Inter-Subgraph Edge Encoding**: Edges connecting different subgraphs are separately encoded, ensuring that the relationships between subgraphs are preserved in a compact format.
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Gap encoding is compared to adjacency matrix encoding by evaluating memory usage, encoding time, and the number of inter-subgraph edges across graphs of varying sizes.
5. **Scalability Testing**: Using graphs of increasing size, the scalability of the gap encoding method is evaluated. Results demonstrate that gap encoding consistently outperforms adjacency matrices in memory usage and encoding speed, maintaining efficiency even as graph complexity increases.

Finally, the results are visualized through plots showing encoding time, memory usage, and inter-subgraph edge counts, highlighting the advantages of hierarchical gap encoding for large-scale graph datasets. This method proves particularly effective for resource-constrained environments, ensuring efficient processing of complex graph structures.
